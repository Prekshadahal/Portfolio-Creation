						<p>For developing this website, I went through various samples of website called pinterest.com. The website contained various designs and layout of websies. However, the aesthetic deigns and templates really tempted me. Thus, I downloaded some plain designs from the same website and went for aesthetic look and design.</p></br>
						The comparision of the layouts and theme that I selected and my actual website is made below;
						<div class="pinterest">
							<img src="research1.png" height="400" width="600">
							<br>fig: Ideas from pinterest.</br>

							<img src="research2.png" height="300" width="700" align ="right">


							<img src="research3.png" height="400" width="700"><!-- Adding images and defining its height and width-->
							<br>fig: My design of Blog and homepage.

							<h4>
								I also googled the color codes of the aesthetic colors from different websites and came up with various new colours among which I used in font-color of navigation bar in some pages and also in the background color of this particular web page.
